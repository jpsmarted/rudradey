       <h1>HAPPY TEACHER'S DAY</h1>
      <p>Thank you all for teaching all of us how to read and write, for guiding
        us to distinguish between what is wrong and what is right. Thank you all
        for being our mentor and light. Without you all, we would have been
        lost. Thank you all teachers for guiding us, inspiring us, and making us
        what we are today. Wish you all teachers a HAPPY TEACHER'S DAY!</p>
